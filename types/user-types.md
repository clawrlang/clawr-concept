# User-Defined Types

There are several classes of user-defined types:

- A `data` structure is a simple aggregate of related information.
- An `object` is an encapsulated (hidden) `data` structure with behaviour-first design.
- A `trait` is an an abstract interface that may be implemented by `data` oriented types.
- A `service` is an object whose state is defined by the system, not (or not primarily) by a `data` structure.
- A `role` is a capability that a `service` may embody.
- An `enum` is a list of available values a type allows.
- A `union` type can have values that are structured in multiple ways.
