# Clawr Semantics System

![Rawrderick the Lion](../images/rawry.png)

Clawr uses a revolutionary semantics system. Other languages choose semantics on the type level. Clawr provides more granularity — and hopefully more clarity as a consequence.

- Clawr’s [Per-Variable Semantics](./variable-scope.md)
- [Here is a Mental Model](./mental-model.md) to help thinking about the terms
- How does this affect [Function Parameters](./function-parameters.md)?
- …and [Return-Values](./return-values.md)?
- Here’s [an example](./implementation.md) of how it can work [in practice](./implementation.md)
- … and a [sketch](./runtime.md) of the [runtime implementation](./runtime.md)
