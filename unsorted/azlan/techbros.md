# Azlan is not a Tech-Bro Language

- If you want to tweak memory management, use a different language.
- If you want to decide what constants are serialized in the machine code, use a different language.
- If you want to riddle your code with safety-tags, use a different language.

# Azlan Works

That is a primary goal of this language: it should just work.

- It should be intuitive.
- It should be easy to refactor.
- And you should be able to focus on modelling rather than messing around with minutiae
