# Rawry the Lion

![Rawry](../images/rawry-big.png)
Meet Roderick the Lion, known as “Rawry” for short.

Rawry is angry. He is angry at code that focuses too much on implementation and technicalities and distracts from understanding the application’s domain. He is angry at status seeking technologists writing “clever code” that only they themselves can understand.

He has patched one eye because it burns and stings when he looks at code that couples to implementation details, to data structures and to the idioms of technical frameworks.

He asks that you start **solving problems** instead of “building solutions.”

> [!tip] Solve the Problem. Don’t Build a Solution!
> - Focus on the domain, not the technology.
> - Don’t model structures. Model what happens.
> - Be suspicious of code and tasks that cannot be traced to explicit value.
> - Be ready to change your design as needs and priorities — and your understanding of them — evolve.
