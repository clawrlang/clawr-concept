Meet Rawrderick or “Rawry” for short.

Rawry is angry. He is angry at code that focuses too much on implementation and technicalities and distracts from understanding the application’s domain. He is angry at status seeking technologists writing “clever code” that only they themselves can understand.

He has patched one eye because it burns and stings when he looks at code that couples to implementation details, to data structures and to the idioms of technical frameworks.

He asks that you start solving problems instead of building “solutions.”
