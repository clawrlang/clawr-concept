# Contributing to Clawr

Thanks for your interest! Clawr should be a community project, not a one-man show.

I want Clawr to be the best programming language it can be. Therefore, I gladly welcome contributions from various backgrounds and perspectives. I only ask that you honour the fundamental philosophy and goals of Clawr:

- Clawr should encourage programmers to focus on their domain, not the technology.
- Foster loose coupling and outside.in design. Discourage (or eliminate if possible) coupling to structural design elements and tooling.
- Performance optimisations should be handled automatically as much as possible. Avoid silliness like C#’s `const` vs `readonly`.
- Safety comes from clarity of intent, not from distracting clutter and technicalities.

A few ground rules:

- I do not guarantee to respond to issues or PRs within any timeframe.
- Stewardship can be transferred if multiple people commit to maintaining and honouring the project.
- Please follow the code style and include unit tests for new features.

If you want to help moderate/curate this discussion and documentation, please open a PR adding yourself to the [CURATORS](CURATORS.md) list.
