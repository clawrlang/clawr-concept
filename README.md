# Clawr Programming Language

![Rawr!|150](./images/rawr.png)
This repository exists to collect ideas and concepts for a new programming language, Clawr.

## the Philosophy of Clawr

- Clarity of intent is the first priority. Modelling and behaviours should be the main things on display. DRY is good, but DAMP is better.
- Performance optimisations should be handled automatically as much as possible.
- No tech-bro features. Security, safety and performance are all good qualities, but they should emerge from good programming; they should not obscure intent or distract from the model.

Clawr is a language with goals of clarity, a modelling focus and easy refactoring. The name is a portmanteau of the word ”clarity,” and a lion’s roar.
